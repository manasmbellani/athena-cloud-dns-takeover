# athena-cloud-dns-takeover

## Introduction 

This repository that contains scripts to perform cloud DNS takeover checks and exploits

More info about these types of takeovers is described here: 
* https://medium.com/@shivsahni2/aws-ns-takeover-356d2a293bca
* https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-ns/
* https://thehackerblog.com/the-orphaned-internet-taking-over-120k-domains-via-a-dns-vulnerability-in-aws-google-cloud-rackspace-and-digital-ocean/

Currently, this project only provides script(s) to check for DNS takeover vulnerability. PoC scripts 
to exploit the vulnerability will also be added in the near future.

## Scripts

### cloud_dns_takeover_check.sh

```
# Script uses 'dig' locally installed command to determine if DNS Subdomain takeover possible on    
# domains hosted with various Cloud providers such as AWS Route53 due to dangling DNS (non-existant) 
# record sets, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud and others.                                              
#                                                                                                   
# Script locates authority nameservers for subdomain AND its parent domain, checking response       
# provided when the subdomain is resolved through each authority nameserver. If particular response 
# returned such as SERVFAIL/REFUSED when querying the subdomain's nameserver and the parent domain's 
# nameserver, then it is possible to takeover this subdomain by creating the a new DNS recordset with 
# one of the same authority nameservers allocated through the cloud provider for the newly created  
# recordset.

```
# Script uses 'awscli' to exploit Route53 Dangling entries in hosted zones.                         
#                                                                                                   
# Script first checks whether a domain is vulnerable using the check script in the existing         
# directory. If it is, then it will check if it has any AWS nameservers, extract these AWS authority 
# nameservers, and then start creating hosted zones in Route53 using the profile credentials until  
# it finds atleast one nameserver in the newly created hosted zone that matches the vulnerable      
# authority nameserver.
